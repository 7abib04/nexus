# Buy-01 Marketplace

This repository contains the marketplace frontend plus the Spring Boot microservices backend:

- `frontend`: Angular web app served through Nginx in Docker
- `discovery-service`: Eureka service registry
- `gateway-service`: API gateway with CORS, JWT validation on protected routes, auth header propagation, and in-memory rate limiting for auth/media writes
- `user-service`: registration, login, JWT issuance, profile management, seller avatar upload delegation, and optional admin bootstrap
- `product-service`: public product reads plus seller/admin CRUD with ownership enforcement, keyword/category/price search, and media ownership synchronization
- `media-service`: seller/admin image upload/list/delete, public image download, MIME sniffing, 2 MB limit, MinIO-backed object storage, and product ownership validation
- `order-service`: shopping cart, checkout (Pay on Delivery), buyer/seller order management, and buyer/seller spend and revenue analytics

## One-Command Docker Run

From the repository root:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

That starts the full stack:

- Angular frontend on `https://localhost`
- API gateway on `http://localhost:8080`
- Eureka dashboard on `http://localhost:8761`
- MongoDB on `localhost:27017`
- MinIO API on `http://localhost:9000`
- MinIO console on `http://localhost:9001`

To stop it:

```bash
docker compose down
```

To stop it and also remove the named MongoDB and MinIO volumes:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

Notes:

- the first build can take a while because Docker has to build the Angular app and package each Spring Boot service
- the frontend proxies `/api/*` to the gateway, so the browser only needs `https://localhost`
- the first browser visit will warn because the local certificate is self-signed
- media URLs resolve through the frontend proxy as `https://localhost/api/media/images/...`
- the backend service ports remain exposed over HTTP for direct debugging on `8080` to `8084`

## Docker Hub Fallback

If Docker Desktop starts failing to resolve `node:20-alpine` with an `auth.docker.io` `522` error, use the Windows PowerShell fallback instead:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\start-stack.ps1
```

That fallback:

- builds the Angular frontend with the locally installed `node` and `npm`
- starts the backend services with Docker Compose
- serves the built frontend assets from `nginx:1.27-alpine` through `docker-compose.frontend-static.yml`

If `frontend/node_modules` is missing, add `-InstallFrontendDependencies` once:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\start-stack.ps1 -InstallFrontendDependencies
```

## HTTPS

Local HTTPS is now the default Docker Compose path. If you want a small PowerShell wrapper instead of typing the compose command yourself, use:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\start-docker-https.ps1
```

That script now starts the same root `docker-compose.yml` flow for `https://localhost`.

For a public deployment, the same script can still use Let's Encrypt when you pass real domains and an email address:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\start-docker-https.ps1 `
  -HttpsDomains shop.example.com,www.shop.example.com `
  -LetsEncryptEmail ops@example.com
```

That public-domain path adds `docker-compose.https.yml` on top of the main compose so ACME validation can use port `80`.

Renew certificates for the Docker-built frontend path with:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\renew-https-cert.ps1 -UseDockerFrontend
```

## Tech Stack

- Java 17
- Spring Boot 3.3.5
- Spring Cloud 2023.0.3
- Spring Security
- MongoDB
- Eureka Discovery
- Spring Cloud Gateway
- Nexus Repository Manager (artifact/dependency/Docker registry, see [`nexus/README.md`](nexus/README.md))

## Implemented Backend Features

- `POST /auth/register`, `POST /auth/login`
- `GET /me`, `PUT /me` (JSON and multipart form-data variants)
- `GET /products`, `GET /products/{id}`
- `GET /products/search` (keyword + category + price range, sort, pagination, and facets)
- `GET /products/me`, `POST /products`, `PUT /products/{id}`, `DELETE /products/{id}`
- `GET /media/images/{id}`
- `GET /media/images`, `POST /media/images`, `DELETE /media/images/{id}`
- `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /cart`, `/cart/items`, `/cart/items/{productId}`
- `POST /orders/checkout` (Pay on Delivery), `GET /orders`, `GET /orders/{id}`, `PATCH /orders/{id}/cancel`, `POST /orders/{id}/redo`, `DELETE /orders/{id}`
- `GET /orders/seller`, `PATCH /orders/{id}/status` (seller order fulfillment)
- `GET /orders/analytics/me`, `GET /orders/analytics/seller` (buyer/seller spend and revenue analytics)
- JWT validation in the gateway, product service, media service, and order service
- Seller ownership checks for product and media mutations, including cross-service image ownership validation
- Seller avatar upload through `user-service`, delegated to `media-service`
- Global exception handlers with `400/401/403/404/415`
- `/actuator/health` and `/actuator/info` exposure on all services
- Gateway rate limiting for auth and media write endpoints
- Optional Kafka event publication for product and image lifecycle events
- Optional HTTPS startup path with a generated local development certificate

## Security Notes

- Passwords are hashed with BCrypt in `user-service`
- JWTs include `userId` and `role` claims
- Public routes are limited to auth, product reads, and image reads
- Media uploads accept `image/*` only, enforce `<= 2 MB`, and sniff file signatures before storage
- Files are stored outside MongoDB in an S3-compatible object store (MinIO by default for local development)
- `ADMIN` users can be bootstrapped through environment variables but cannot self-register through the public API

## Local Run

If you do not want Docker for the full stack, the backend can still be started manually as before.

1. Start MongoDB and MinIO:

```bash
cd backend
docker compose up -d
```

Fastest option on Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\backend\scripts\start-backend.ps1 -Clean -StopExisting
```

That script:

- starts MongoDB and MinIO
- runs `mvn clean` once when `-Clean` is provided
- can stop existing backend listeners first when `-StopExisting` is provided
- opens separate PowerShell windows for discovery, gateway, user, product, and media services
- supports `-SkipObjectStorage` if you already have MinIO running
- supports `-UseHttps` to launch the full stack over HTTPS with a generated local certificate

If MongoDB and MinIO are already running, use:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\backend\scripts\start-backend.ps1 -Clean -StopExisting -SkipMongo -SkipObjectStorage
```

If you only want to stop the backend services that are currently listening on the standard ports:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\backend\scripts\stop-backend.ps1
```

2. Start the discovery service:

```bash
cd backend
mvn -pl discovery-service spring-boot:run
```

3. Start the remaining services in separate terminals:

```bash
cd backend
mvn -pl gateway-service spring-boot:run
```

```bash
cd backend
mvn -pl user-service spring-boot:run
```

```bash
cd backend
mvn -pl product-service spring-boot:run
```

```bash
cd backend
mvn -pl media-service spring-boot:run
```

```bash
cd backend
mvn -pl order-service spring-boot:run
```

## Quick API Examples

Register a seller:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/auth/register ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -d "{\"email\":\"seller@example.com\",\"password\":\"Password123\",\"fullName\":\"Seller\",\"role\":\"SELLER\"}"
```

Create a product:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/products ^
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -d "{\"name\":\"Phone\",\"description\":\"Flagship phone\",\"price\":699.99,\"quantity\":5,\"imageUrls\":[]}"
```

Upload an image:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/media/images ^
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" ^
  -F "file=@C:\\path\\image.png" ^
  -F "productId=<product-id>"
```

Update seller profile with avatar:

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/me ^
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" ^
  -F "fullName=Seller Updated" ^
  -F "avatar=@C:\\path\\avatar.png;type=image/png"
```

## Verification

The backend was verified with:

```bash
cd backend
mvn -q clean test
```

The live stack was also verified with:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\backend\scripts\test-backend.ps1
```

HTTPS with the local development certificate:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\backend\scripts\test-backend.ps1 -UseHttps -SkipCertificateValidation
```

If admin bootstrap is enabled before startup, include the same credentials in the smoke test so the admin-only checks run too:

```powershell
$env:ADMIN_EMAIL = "admin@example.com"
$env:ADMIN_PASSWORD = "Password123"
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\backend\scripts\start-backend.ps1 -Clean -StopExisting
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\backend\scripts\test-backend.ps1 -AdminEmail $env:ADMIN_EMAIL -AdminPassword $env:ADMIN_PASSWORD
```

The smoke test now covers:

- health endpoints and gateway routing
- public registration/login flows plus rejection of public `ADMIN` registration
- delegated avatar upload, avatar replacement, and old-avatar cleanup
- product validation, seller ownership checks, and cross-service image ownership validation
- media validation, media filtering by `productId`, public image caching headers, and post-delete download failures
- gateway rate limiting for auth and media write endpoints
- optional admin bootstrap login plus admin access to seller-owned products and media

## Code Quality (SonarQube)

Static analysis and security scanning run against two SonarQube projects —
`buy-01-backend` (the Maven reactor) and `buy-01-frontend` (the Angular app):

- **Local dashboard**: a persistent SonarQube instance you can browse, connect
  SonarLint to, and track trends over time — see [`sonarqube/README.md`](sonarqube/README.md)
  for setup, project/token creation, permissions, and notifications.
- **GitHub Actions**: [`.github/workflows/sonarqube.yml`](.github/workflows/sonarqube.yml)
  scans both projects on every push and pull request against a throwaway SonarQube
  instance spun up inside the CI job itself (no secrets or local machine access
  required) and **fails the build** if either quality gate doesn't pass.
- **Jenkins**: the [`Jenkinsfile`](Jenkinsfile)'s `SonarQube Analysis` /
  `SonarQube Quality Gate` stages do the same scan against the persistent local
  instance once you've generated a token — see
  [`jenkins/README.md`](jenkins/README.md#6-sonarqube-quality-gate).

### Review & approval process

1. Open a pull request against `main`. `.github/pull_request_template.md` prompts for
   a checklist: tests pass, both SonarQube quality gates are green, any remaining
   Blocker/Critical issues or un-reviewed security hotspots are explicitly justified,
   and at least one reviewer has approved.
2. `SonarQube Quality Gate` (GitHub Actions) runs automatically and reports a status
   check on the PR.
3. To make that check and a review actually mandatory before merge (recommended, not
   yet configured because it requires repo admin access via the GitHub web UI): go to
   **Settings → Branches → Add branch protection rule** for `main`, enable
   **Require a pull request before merging** with **≥ 1 approving review**, enable
   **Require status checks to pass before merging** and select **SonarQube Quality
   Gate**, then save.
4. Once a Blocker/Critical issue or security hotspot is fixed, push the fix to the
   same PR branch — the workflow re-runs automatically and the check updates.

## Artifact Management (Nexus)

A self-hosted [Nexus Repository Manager](nexus/README.md) is the artifact store and
dependency proxy for the backend Maven reactor, and the private Docker registry for
every service + frontend image:

- Maven `hosted` (releases/snapshots), `proxy` (Maven Central), and `group` repositories
- Docker `hosted`, `proxy` (Docker Hub), and `group` repositories
- `mvn deploy` publishes versioned JARs; a `mirrorOf: *` Maven mirror resolves every
  dependency exclusively through Nexus instead of the public internet
- `docker push`/`docker pull` against the Nexus-hosted registry
- RBAC: a least-privilege `jenkins-deployer` service account (publish rights only to
  buy-01's own repos) and a `dev-readonly` account (pull-only), instead of sharing `admin`
- Runs under a dedicated non-root `nexus` user, never root

See [`nexus/README.md`](nexus/README.md) for setup, the Maven/Docker integration, the
versioning workflow, and how it wires into the Jenkins pipeline below.

## Notes

- The three services use separate Mongo databases on the same local Mongo instance by default.
- MinIO is the default local object store so image binaries are not stored in MongoDB.
- Kafka publishing is implemented but disabled by default so local development does not require a broker.
- `backend/scripts/generate-dev-certs.ps1` can generate a shared PKCS12 certificate for local HTTPS runs.
